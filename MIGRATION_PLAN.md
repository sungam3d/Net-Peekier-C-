# Net-Peekier → C# / .NET 8 migration plan

Living progress doc. As pieces land, the checkboxes get ticked and notes get
appended.

> **Tech choices made (defaults — change if you prefer):**
> - **Language:** C# 12 / .NET 8
> - **GUI:** WPF (MVVM). Mature, well-documented, friendlier to single-exe
>   publishing than WinUI 3 right now. We can swap to WinUI later — the
>   `NetPeekier.Core` layer is GUI-agnostic.
> - **Publish:** `dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained` with
>   `PublishSingleFile=true`.
> - **Privileges:** embedded manifest requests `requireAdministrator`. WFP
>   filter changes and ETW kernel sessions both need it.
> - **Enforcement engine:** WFP user-mode API (`fwpuclnt.dll`) — same kernel
>   firewall engine Windows itself uses. **No third-party driver. No netsh.**
> - **Monitoring engine:** ETW (`Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Network` provider)
>   for per-process byte counts + IP Helper (`iphlpapi.dll`
>   `GetExtendedTcpTable` / `GetExtendedUdpTable`) for the connection table.

## Honest scope changes vs. the Python app

| Feature                                  | Python (now)              | C# port plan                   |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Process list + connections + ports       | psutil                    | **IP Helper API** ✅           |
| Per-process up/down bytes (now + total)  | WinDivert sniff           | **ETW Kernel-Network** (pending) |
| Per-app block (persistent)               | netsh                     | **WFP filter, per-app token** ✅ |
| Per-IP allow / block / whitelist         | netsh + IP-set arithmetic | **WFP filter**, same arithmetic ✅ |

| Live packet view + hex dump              | WinDivert                 | **Npcap** (optional, read-only)|
| Per-process speed limit (throttle)       | WinDivert token bucket    | **DROPPED** *(see note)*       |
| System stats (CPU/GPU/RAM/temps)         | psutil + HardwareMonitor  | PerfCounter + LibreHWM dll     |
| History log                              | plain file                | plain file ✅                  |

**Feature notes:**

1. **Hex/packet view is BACK, via Npcap.** Originally dropped (it needs a
   kernel-level capture component), it's now restored using Npcap — the same
   signed, trusted driver Wireshark uses — instead of WinDivert. Npcap is an
   optional user-installed dependency: if absent, the Packets window shows an
   install prompt and the rest of the app is unaffected. Capture is
   read-only and completely separate from the WFP blocking path, so it can't
   cause the kind of packet-path instability the old WinDivert build had.
   PID attribution is by local-port correlation against the connection table
   (same approach as the Python build).
2. **Throttling is still replaced with finer-grained blocking.** Inline
   byte-rate throttling genuinely needs to sit *in* the packet path (not just
   observe it), which Npcap can't do — that remains a WFP per-IP-rule story:
   "Chrome can talk to *these* IPs/ports but nothing else".

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Scaffolding ✅ DONE
- [x] Solution + three projects
- [x] Embedded manifest with `requireAdministrator`
- [x] `dotnet publish` wired to single-exe
- [x] Core + Native compile clean against .NET 8

### Phase 1 — Core layer (no Win32) ✅ DONE
- [x] `Models.cs`: Connection, ConnectionEvent, ProcStat, Totals
- [x] `Paths.cs`: Root, settings.txt, log/
- [x] `Settings.cs`: load/save with atomic write, all Python fields
- [x] `Formatting.cs`: HumanSpeed / HumanBytes / PortsStr
- [x] `IpCalc.cs`: full port of Python interval math (BigInteger v4 + v6)
- [x] `History.cs`: rolling log
- [x] **97/97 tests passing**: IpCalc, Settings round-trip, Formatting, WfpFirewall.ValidExe

### Phase 2 — Native: monitor (read-only) ✅ DONE
- [x] `IpHelper.cs`: hand-rolled P/Invoke for TCP4 / TCP6 / UDP4 / UDP6 tables
- [x] `ProcessMap.cs`: pid↔endpoint table, name/exe cache, PID-reuse check
- [x] `NetworkMonitor.cs`: full tick body ported from `monitor._tick`
      (idle hiding, WAN/LAN classification, history logging, totals,
      dead-PID cleanup, system-IO baseline + fallback)
- [x] `EtwMonitor.cs`: real implementation against
      `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent`. Opens the NT Kernel
      Logger, subscribes to TcpIp{Send,Recv} + TcpIp{Send,Recv}IPV6 +
      UdpIp{Send,Recv} + UdpIp{Send,Recv}IPV6, accumulates bytes per-PID
      and per-ConnectionKey. NuGet restore now required for Native.
      Falls back cleanly when not elevated or kernel session is
      already held by another consumer.

### Phase 3 — Native: WFP firewall ✅ STRUCTURALLY COMPLETE
- [x] `Wfp/Native.cs`: hand-rolled P/Invoke for `fwpuclnt.dll`
      (engine open/close, transactions, provider / sublayer / filter CRUD,
      FwpmGetAppIdFromFileName0)
- [x] `Wfp/Guids.cs`: well-known layer + condition GUIDs, plus stable
      provider + sublayer GUIDs that identify Net-Peekier
- [x] `Wfp/Conditions.cs`: arena-based condition builders for AppId,
      RemoteIPv4 / IPv4Cidr / IPv6Cidr, RemotePort, IpProtocol
- [x] `WfpFirewall.cs`: BlockApp / UnblockApp / IsBlocked / ListBlocked,
      AddIpRule / RemoveIpRule / RemoveAllIpRules, SetWhitelist (uses
      `IpCalc.BlockRangesExcept`), RemoveAllRules
- [x] Monitor wires it all together: `Firewall` property (lazy, null on
      non-Windows or non-elevated), `SyncFirewall` reconciliation,
      `SetBlocked` / `AddIpRule` / `RemoveIpRule` / `SetFirewallEnabled` /
      `RemoveAllFirewallRules` direct edit surface, `LockdownSweep` full
      implementation including temp-allow expiry
- [ ] **Verify on a Windows box** — the WFP code compiles clean but has
      not been exercised against a real `fwpuclnt.dll`. Smoke-test plan:
      1. Launch elevated, confirm `Firewall is not null`.
      2. Block notepad.exe → run notepad with `curl http://example.com` →
         confirm `ECONNREFUSED`.
      3. Unblock, re-run, confirm traffic flows.
      4. Add an IP rule for notepad, verify in `netsh wfp show filters` it
         shows under our sublayer GUID.

### Phase 4 — GUI ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] MVVM scaffold: `ObservableObject`, `RelayCommand`, `MainViewModel`
- [x] MainWindow: dashboard (up/down/peak/session), live DataGrid bound to
      `Processes`, in-place row reconciliation by PID (no flicker / no
      selection loss), menu with File / Firewall / View / Help
- [x] ConnectionsWindow: double-click a process to see its live socket
      list, refreshes 1Hz, closes itself if the PID disappears
- [x] FirewallWindow: tabs for blocked apps + IP rules; unblock /
      add / remove / remove-all
- [x] IpRuleDialog: modal form with `IpCalc.ValidIpSpec` / `ValidPorts` /
      `WfpFirewall.ValidExe` validation before OK
- [x] SettingsWindow: speed unit, idle hide, lockdown toggle, temp-allow
      duration, show-LAN/WAN, packet-purge minutes, LAN ranges with CIDR
      validation; calls `ApplySettings(syncFirewall: true)` so changes
      take effect immediately
- [x] LockdownDialog: prompted from `App.ShowLockdownPrompt`, three
      buttons (block permanently / temp allow / allow permanently) wired
      to Monitor.LockdownBlock / AllowTemporarily / SetAllowed; per-exe
      dedupe so a chatty process doesn't pile up dialogs
- [x] AboutWindow: proper window with version from assembly metadata
- [x] Window-geometry persistence: WindowGeometryPersistence helper
      restores Left/Top/Width/Height on open and saves on close (Main,
      Connections, Firewall use it)
- [x] StatsWindow + SystemStats backend (CPU/RAM via PerformanceCounter,
      CPU clock via registry, optional CPU/GPU/RAM temps + GPU load/clock
      via LibreHardwareMonitorLib.dll loaded by reflection — drop the dll
      next to the exe to light up temps, absent = "--")
- [x] Hierarchical app list: TreeView grouping PIDs by process name
      (the svchost.exe cluster collapses under one expandable parent with
      summed up/down/total). Reconciled in place by name+PID so expand/
      collapse and selection survive ticks. Group or leaf both selectable;
      block/unblock and double-click-for-connections resolve a PID from
      either. Matches the Python build's Treeview UX.

### Phase 5 — Polish + publish
- [x] Version metadata embedded in NetPeekier.App.csproj (2.0.0)
- [x] `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent` integrated;
      `EtwMonitor` is now the real implementation (Phase 2 task moved
      here historically; now actually done)
- [x] `dotnet publish` produces a single `NetPeekier.exe` (verified
      on Windows 11 26200, single-file self-contained)
- [ ] App icon (provide an .ico, reference from csproj)
- [ ] Sign the exe (optional; smooths SmartScreen)
- [ ] Smoke test on Windows 11 23H2 + 24H2 fresh installs
      (preliminary verification on 26200 ✓)
- [ ] Decide AOT / Avalonia migration (notes at bottom)

---

## AOT path (later)

WPF doesn't target NativeAOT. Two routes:

1. **Stay on WPF + PublishSingleFile + trimming.** One ~30–60 MB exe with
   the .NET runtime bundled.
2. **Move the GUI to Avalonia.** Avalonia supports AOT today and the API
   is close enough to WPF that the migration is mechanical. Result: a
   tiny native exe with no .NET install required.

Decide at Phase 5.

---

## Build & run

```powershell
dotnet restore        # once you're online (pulls TraceEvent when re-enabled)
dotnet build
dotnet run --project tests/NetPeekier.Core.Tests
dotnet publish src/NetPeekier.App/NetPeekier.App.csproj -c Release
# Output: src/NetPeekier.App/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/NetPeekier.exe
```

The included `nuget.config` clears package sources to let the sandbox build
without internet. Delete it (or replace it with your normal one) on a
machine with NuGet access — you'll want `TraceEvent` for Phase 5.

---

## Status log (newest first)

- **2026-06-15 — "Listening Ports" → "Active Ports" (broader meaning).**
  - Renamed the column to "Active Ports" and changed what it shows: every
    local port the process is using now (any connection state, not just
    LISTEN), unioned with the ports it has used on earlier ticks while
    we've been watching it — i.e. "is or has ever used". Client apps now
    show their ephemeral local ports, not just servers.
  - ProcessMap.ListeningPorts(conns) → ActivePorts(conns), now returns all
    local ports (LocalPort != 0) regardless of status. The monitor keeps a
    per-pid SortedSet (_everPorts) and unions each tick's active ports into
    it; the set is cleared when the pid dies (so a recycled pid can't
    inherit stale ports). ProcStat.ListeningPorts (the property) and the
    "Listening" sort key were left as internal names to avoid a churny
    rename; only the user-facing label changed. 97/97 Core tests pass.

- **2026-06-15 — UX batch: sortable/resizable columns, tabs, lockdown 4-way, tag combo.**
  - Main list columns are now click-to-sort (▲/▼ arrows; numeric columns
    sort on raw bytes, not formatted text), resizable via splitters
    between the headers (shared-size column groups so rows stay aligned),
    and the widths persist to Settings.ColumnWidths["main"] on close and
    restore on open. Cell text centered.
  - Connections window: was reading the display-filtered snapshot (which
    hides idle/listener processes) so the target PID often wasn't found →
    "exited" + no rows. Now reads the connection table directly by PID, so
    connections always show and double-click opens the packet feed.
  - Connections window also shows the exe path + file details
    (description, company, version, size) pulled from the binary.
  - Set-tag dialog is now an editable ComboBox seeded with existing tags
    (pick one or type a new name).
  - Firewall Manager gained two tabs: "Allowed apps" (Lockdown allow-list,
    remove to re-prompt) and "Tag rules" (block/unblock/allow/unallow a
    tag, applied via ApplySettings(syncFirewall:true)). Now 4 tabs total:
    Blocked apps, Allowed apps, IP rules, Tag rules.
  - Lockdown dialog now has the full 4 options: Temp allow / Allow
    permanently / Disallow (session block) / Block permanently. The
    per-exe one-prompt trigger logic was already correct.
  - Process inclusion tightened: only processes with an active (non-LISTEN)
    connection or measurable traffic are shown. "Hide idle processes
    after" works as: 0 = drop instantly when no current traffic, N = drop
    after N idle minutes (and clear that pid's packet log), blank = never.
    Reverted the mistaken row-linger repurposing of the packet-purge
    setting; it's now "Keep packet logs for: N minutes" and purges the
    capture buffer by age. 97/97 Core tests still pass.

- **2026-06-14 — Fixed: all rows showing "PID n", no stats, fast vanishing.**
  - Root cause of the names: ProcessMap.Name/Exe used
    Process.ProcessName / MainModule, which throw on most services /
    elevated / cross-bitness processes — and the catch block then
    *poison-cached* the "PID n" fallback forever, so every row degraded to
    a numeric name. Rewrote resolution to use Win32
    QueryFullProcessImageName via a QueryLimitedInformation OpenProcess
    handle (works for almost everything when elevated), with the managed
    API only as a fallback, and stopped caching the fallback as authoritative.
  - "Forget pids after N minutes" now does what the label implies: a
    quiet-but-alive process lingers (with its last-known stats, rates
    zeroed) for the configured window instead of blinking out the instant
    it has no live connection. New _lastSeen / _lastStat linger caches;
    pids re-enter the working set while within the window and are expired
    once it passes and the process is gone. Relabelled "Keep idle
    processes for: N minutes".
  - ProcStat is now a record (enables the `with`-clone for the lingering
    snapshot). 97/97 Core tests still pass.
  - Missing speeds/totals are expected without elevation: per-process
    bytes come from the ETW kernel session (admin-only). Without it the
    list still shows names, connections and listening ports via IP Helper;
    the status bar flags that speeds need elevation.

- **2026-06-14 — GUI brought to full Python parity + app icon/logo.**
  - MainWindow rebuilt to match the Python layout exactly: title
    "Net-Peekier  -  per-process network monitor", 880×560 default /
    700×420 min, main bg #d6dce4. Dark-navy dashboard (#10212e, ridge)
    with three columns separated by #1d3a4d dividers: UPLOAD (orange
    #ffb454), DOWNLOAD (cyan #7fe3ff), and SYSTEM. Each up/down column
    shows NOW (Consolas bold) / PEAK / TOTAL.
  - SYSTEM column integrated into the dashboard (replaces the old
    "session total"): CPU / GPU / RAM rows with LOAD / CLOCK / TEMP.
    Per request, RAM shows LOAD only — its clock + temp are omitted.
    Fed by the existing SystemMonitor; MHz→GHz formatting, °/% suffixes
    match sysstats.py.
  - Filter toolbar matches Python: Show LAN / Show WAN on the left (with
    the explanatory hint), Lockdown Mode + Enable Firewall + the ● status
    light (green #1e9e3e on / red #cc2b2b off) on the right. Toggling
    Lockdown auto-enables the firewall, exactly like the original.
  - Process list shows the process NAME (grouped tree, name → PIDs), not
    a bare PID column. Right-click context menu ported in full: Show
    connections / End Process / Open Program Path / Set tag… / Remove tag
    / Block / Unblock / Allow (Lockdown allow-list) / Remove from
    allow-list / Firewall and Tags…. Row text tint mirrors the Python
    stripe tags (blocked = red, active = dark, idle = grey).
  - Lockdown mode fully wired: new NetworkMonitor.SetLockdown(), the
    LockdownSweep default-deny enforcement, and the per-exe allow/block
    prompt (LockdownDialog) that was already present.
  - Menus match Python: File ▸ Exit; Statistics (direct); View ▸ Packets;
    Settings ▸ (Firewall and Tags, Preferences); Help ▸ About.
  - Status bar (bg #c3cbd6) shows backend mode + a "NOT elevated" hint
    when not admin.
  - App icon + logo: the uploaded PNG converted to a multi-resolution
    app.ico (16→256 px) wired via <ApplicationIcon>; the icon also shows
    as the window icon and in the About box. Assets bundled as WPF
    resources.
  - Added a small TagPromptDialog (WPF has no built-in InputBox) for the
    Set-tag action. 97/97 Core tests still pass; VM + row/group verified
    against stubs.

- **2026-06-14 — Packet capture + hex view restored (via Npcap).**
  - The payload/hex packet view — originally dropped with WinDivert — is
    back, built on Npcap (SharpPcap 6.3 + PacketDotNet 1.4). Read-only
    capture that sits alongside WFP/ETW without touching them, so none of
    the old WinDivert packet-path instability applies.
  - `PacketCapture` (Native): opens all live adapters, parses each frame to
    its transport payload, correlates to a PID by local-port lookup against
    ProcessMap's connection table, and pushes into a bounded ring buffer
    (5000). Supports pause, clear, capacity, and per-PID filter. Detects
    Npcap by probing for wpcap.dll and degrades gracefully if absent
    (Available=false).
  - `PacketsWindow` (App): live grid (time/proc/pid/proto/dir/local/remote/
    len) over a Wireshark-style offset/hex/ASCII payload dump, with a
    process filter dropdown, pause/resume, and clear. If Npcap is missing,
    shows a "Download Npcap" prompt with a re-check button instead. Capture
    starts lazily on first open (it has overhead). New CapturedPacket model
    in Core carries the payload bytes; hex formatter verified against a real
    HTTP request.
  - Npcap is optional + user-installed (license can't be bundled). Added to
    README + THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.
  - 97/97 tests still pass.

- **2026-06-14 — LibreHardwareMonitor bundled via NuGet (no more drop-in dll).**
  - The reflection-loaded "drop LibreHardwareMonitorLib.dll next to the exe"
    approach was confusing in practice (the dll has to sit beside the
    *published* exe, not the build output, and the published single-file
    exe self-extracts to a temp dir, so a hand-placed dll wasn't found).
    Replaced it with a proper `LibreHardwareMonitorLib` 0.9.6 NuGet
    reference (MPL-2.0, ships its dll + native helper automatically).
  - `SystemStats.cs` LibreHwmBridge rewritten from reflection to the typed
    Computer / IVisitor / IHardware / ISensor API (matches the library's
    official sample). GPU type detection is by enum-name prefix so it's
    robust across library-version enum renames (GpuAti → GpuAmd). Sensor
    selection (_pick / _pick_temp) unchanged.
  - Single-file publish already had `IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract`,
    so the native WinRing0 helper rides along — nothing for the user to
    place by hand now. Temps need admin (manifest already requires it).
  - Added THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md for MPL-2.0 compliance.
  - 97/97 tests still pass.

- **2026-06-14 — Hierarchical app list + stats polish.**
  - Main list is now a grouped tree (TreeView): processes cluster by name,
    so the dozens of svchost.exe instances collapse under one expandable
    parent showing summed up/down/total. New `ProcessGroup` VM +
    `IProcessNode` interface so one set of columns binds to both group and
    leaf rows. Reconciled in place by name (groups) and PID (children) —
    expand/collapse and selection survive each 1Hz tick. Tabular look via
    a fixed-width column header strip aligned to Grid-based item templates.
    Selecting a group acts on its first member's exe; double-click on a
    leaf (or single-member group) opens its connections; multi-member
    groups expand/collapse on double-click instead.
  - StatsWindow: RAM now shows "used / total GB (load%)" via
    GlobalMemoryStatusEx (more intuitive than the bare committed-bytes
    percentage), with the percentage preserved as a fallback. CPU load,
    CPU clock, and RAM all work WITHOUT LibreHardwareMonitorLib.dll — only
    temperatures and GPU details need the optional dll.
  - 97/97 tests still pass (logic-only change to the App layer).

- **2026-06-14 — SystemStats + StatsWindow (CPU/GPU/RAM dashboard).**
  - `SystemStats.cs` ported from sysstats.py. CPU load + RAM% via
    `PerformanceCounter`, CPU base clock from the registry. Optional
    temps/GPU details via LibreHardwareMonitorLib.dll loaded entirely by
    reflection — no compile-time dependency, drop-in: present = temps
    appear, absent = "--". Background polling thread (2s), snapshot read
    by the GUI. `_pick`/`_pick_temp` headline-sensor selection ported
    faithfully (prefers package/core sensors, drops bogus <=0 / >150°C
    readings, avoids GPU hotspot/junction when a better reading exists).
  - `StatsWindow` shows three cards (CPU/GPU/Memory), polls 1Hz, status
    bar names the temp source. Wired into View → Statistics. App now owns
    a `SystemMonitor` alongside `NetworkMonitor`, started/stopped together.
  - `NetPeekier.Native.csproj` gains `System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter`
    and `Microsoft.Win32.Registry` package refs.
  - Refactor: moved `ValidExe` path-validation from `WfpFirewall` (Native)
    into `ExeValidation` (Core). WfpFirewall now delegates. This keeps the
    test project pure-Core — it no longer references Native, so the
    offline `dotnet run` test cycle works again now that Native needs
    NuGet. 97/97 tests still pass.

- **2026-06-14 — Phase 2 complete: real ETW per-process byte counting.**
  - `EtwMonitor.cs` rewritten against
    `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent`. Opens the NT Kernel Logger
    (with defensive Stop of any orphan session from a prior crash), wires
    handlers for the 8 TCP/UDP × send/recv × IPv4/IPv6 event flavours,
    accumulates per-PID and per-Connection bytes into two pairs of
    dictionaries (delta + cumulative).
  - `DrainRates(interval)` snapshots the deltas into bytes/sec rates and
    resets; `PidTotals()` / `ConnTotals()` return the cumulative copies.
    `ForgetPids` drops dead pids from the totals so memory stays bounded.
  - Single-lock thread safety across consumer-thread event handlers and
    monitor-thread reads.
  - Graceful fallback: if `TraceEventSession` construction throws (not
    elevated, another consumer holds the kernel session), Available stays
    false and NetworkMonitor uses its OS-counter path. The log records
    exactly why.
  - `NetPeekier.Native.csproj` now requires `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.TraceEvent 3.1.16`.
    `dotnet restore` once and you're set.

- **2026-06-14 — Phase 4 binding-mode bug + Diag logging.**
  - `DataGridCheckBoxColumn` defaults to TwoWay binding, but the
    `ProcessRow.Blocked` / `UsesWan` properties have private setters.
    WPF threw `InvalidOperationException` at binding-attach time on the
    first paint, before any window was visible. Fix: `Mode=OneWay` on
    both bindings (the cells are display-only; toggling is done via the
    Firewall menu).
  - The Dispatcher unhandled-exception handler used to MessageBox-flood
    on each cascading binding error. Now it uses `Interlocked.CompareExchange`
    to show ONE dialog and shut down cleanly.
  - Added `Diag` — a robust startup logger that never throws. Writes
    breadcrumbs to `log/startup.log` (or fallback paths) so any future
    "won't launch" issues land in a file the user can paste back.
  - Verified end-to-end on Windows 11 26200: clean startup, WFP engine
    opens, ListBlocked works, main window paints, clean shutdown.

- **2026-06-14 — Rename collision fix + WFP layout bug.**
  - `NetPeekier.Native.Monitor` renamed to `NetworkMonitor` everywhere.
    WPF's implicit usings bring in `System.Threading.Monitor`, which
    collided with our class — every App-project source got CS0104. New
    name is more descriptive and self-documenting.
  - `FWP_VALUE0` / `FWP_CONDITION_VALUE0` had a wrongly-added `_padding`
    field. On x64 the natural alignment of `IntPtr` after a `uint`
    already gives the correct 16-byte layout; the extra padding made the
    struct 24 bytes and would have corrupted downstream offsets in
    `FWPM_FILTER0`. Removed.
  - Added `scripts/Verify-WFP.ps1` — admin-elevated PowerShell that
    drives a manual smoke-test of the WFP path against
    `netsh wfp show filters`.
  - WPF MainWindow has `d:IsDesignTimeCreatable=False` to stop the XAML
    designer from trying to instantiate `MainViewModel` (which takes a
    `NetworkMonitor` constructor arg).
  - 97/97 tests still passing.

- **2026-06-13 — Phase 4 functionally complete.**
  - SettingsWindow with full validation (LAN ranges checked via IpCalc;
    minutes fields parsed and bounded). On OK, calls
    `ApplySettings(syncFirewall: true)` so a lockdown-mode toggle takes
    effect immediately.
  - LockdownDialog wired to `Monitor.LockdownPrompt`. App owns the prompt
    callback, marshals to UI thread via Dispatcher.BeginInvoke, dedupes
    per-exe so a chatty process can't pile up dialogs.
  - AboutWindow with version metadata from the assembly (Version=2.0.0
    embedded in NetPeekier.App.csproj).
  - Window-geometry persistence via WindowGeometryPersistence helper;
    Main / Connections / Firewall remember position+size across runs.
  - EtwMonitor.Start changed from throwing to a clean no-op (Available
    stays false; Monitor's OS-counter fallback handles the gap). Removes
    the need for callers to defensively try/catch around a stub.
  - 97/97 tests still passing.

- **2026-06-13 — Phase 3 complete, Phase 4 core views landed.**
  - Project renamed throughout from "Net-Peeker" to "Net-Peekier" (29
    files, namespaces, csproj names, sln file, dir names).
  - WfpFirewall fully implemented: BlockApp / UnblockApp / IsBlocked /
    ListBlocked / AddIpRule / RemoveIpRule / SetWhitelist / RemoveAllRules,
    all routed through a single `SubmitFilter` helper that owns the
    NativeArena lifetime.
  - Monitor now owns the firewall handle lazily, exposes a clean GUI-facing
    edit surface (`SetBlocked` etc.), implements `SyncFirewall` and
    `LockdownSweep` with parity to Python's `monitor.apply_settings` /
    `_lockdown_sweep`.
  - GUI now MVVM: MainViewModel orchestrates the 1Hz refresh, reconciles
    Processes by PID. New: ConnectionsWindow, FirewallWindow, IpRuleDialog
    (with full IpCalc / WfpFirewall validation before submit).
  - 97/97 tests still passing.

- **2026-06-13 — Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 most-of.**
  - Full IpCalc port with BigInteger v4+v6 set arithmetic.
  - 85/85 tests passing in a stand-alone runner (no NuGet needed).
  - Hand-rolled IpHelper P/Invoke for TCP4 / TCP6 / UDP4 / UDP6.
  - Monitor.Tick body fully ported (LAN/WAN classification, idle hiding,
    history logging, dead-PID cleanup, dashboard totals).
  - EtwMonitor stubbed (needs TraceEvent NuGet).
  - Core + Native both build clean against `net8.0`.

- **2026-06-13 — Phase 0 done, Phase 1 scaffolded.**
  - Solution, three projects, manifest, models, paths, settings, formatting.
